			<h3>Adaptation</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<img src="Images\Felipe_Plate_2.jpg" alt="Adaptation Image" class="card-image">
				<p>Adaptation is the 'fit' between organism and environment, yet how adaptations evolve is something we know surprisingly little about because they are constructed from beneficial mutations, which are often very rare and so difficult to study. Our work uses genomics to find the genetic changes that cause adaptation and test competing theories about how adaptations evolve, including the contribution of so-called 'silent' mutations (those that don't change the protein) to this process. </p>

		<div class="card" id="diversification">
			<h3>Diversification</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<img src="Images\Justin_Plate_4.jpeg" alt="Diversification Image" class="card-image">
				<p>Diversification occurs when a single population becomes differentiated into two or more recognizably distinct populations or species.  We study the ecological and genetic factors that drive this process and how they interact to determine the rate and extent of evolutionary diversification. </p>

				<h3>PhD students</h3>
				<div class="members-container">
					<div class="member phd-student">
						<img src="Member Pictures\partha_chakraborty.jpg" alt="Partha Chakraborty">
						<p>
							<strong>Partha Chakraborty</strong><br>
							Partha is interested in looking at the impact of spatial structure on adaptive evolution. To do this, he evolves <i>P. aeruginosa</i> metapopulations in the laboratory by propagating them with varying migration network topologies under antibiotic stress. After obtaining an MSc in Biochemistry from the University of Calcutta, India, Partha briefly worked on the evolution of dispersal in laboratory populations of Drosophila in IISER Pune, India, which sparked his interest in the role of gene flow in adaptive dynamics. His current research will tell us whether spatial structure accelerates the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in microbial populations.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="member phd-student">
						<img src="Member Pictures\angela_alonso.jpg" alt="Luz Angela Alonso Morales">
						<p>
							<strong>Luz Angela Alonso Morales</strong><br>
							Angela is a PhD candidate in Biology at the University of Ottawa . Her work uses a combination of computational, experimental, and molecular Biology to detect adaptive synonymous substitutions through patterns of parallel evolution in a <i>Pseudomonas</i> phylogeny and investigate the mechanisms behind those adaptive synonymous changes. In addition, her research also examines how environmental heterogeneity impacts the genomics of drug resistance in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Her research interests lie in understanding how bacteria adapt, by investigating the correlation between fitness effects and other phenotypic measurements from the lab with the natural populations of bacteria using phylogenomic, computational and molecular perspectives.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="member phd-student">
						<img src="Member Pictures\caio_rosa.jpg" alt="Caio Gomez Tavares Rosa">

							<strong>Caio Gomez Tavares Rosa</strong><br>
							Caio is a PhD student in the Kassen lab, researching experimental evolution with microbes. Originally from Brazil, he earned his bachelor's degree in biology at the University of São Paulo. Driven by his fascination with bacteria he started doing research in the genetics and molecular biology of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, contributing to the characterization of a new gene. Currently, he is exploring the relationship between <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and how they influence each other's evolution. Overall, it has been great doing research here and being immersed in Canada's multicultural environment. He spends his free time enjoying every new activity he can find and getting to know new people. He likes hiking, visiting museums, watching movies, and attending drag shows, but he also appreciates quiet evenings at home with video games.

							<strong>Aditee Ashar</strong><br>
							Aditee is a PhD student whose research focuses on investigating the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH) within microbial populations. With a keen interest in exploring how environmental conditions influence the evolutionary dynamics of interactions over time, she aims to delve into how stressful environments can promote facilitation between microbial species. Her primary objective is to understand the conditions that encourage the evolution of facilitative behaviours among microorganisms. Aditee completed her masters from NMIMS University, India, where she investigated the effect of UV radiations on Antarctic microbes. When she's not in the lab, Aditee can often be found hiking, engrossed in a good book, or indulging her creative side with occasional painting.

					<div class="member msc-student">
						<img src="Stock Images\Burgess Dog.jpg" alt="Justin Ethan Gupta">
						<p>
							<strong>Justin Ethan Gupta</strong><br>
							Justin was first introduced to the world of microbial experimental evolution during his BSc at uOttawa. Joining the Kassen lab as an Honour's student set the stage for his MSc, where his research now centers on the emergence of evolutionary novelties. Employing experimental evolution, he is attempting to understand how bacteria can evolve to utilize novel carbon sources, such as aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX and PAHs) associated with petrol. In this system he seeks to further our understanding of how novel features evolve in nature and the effect of the environment and the genetic architecture of organisms on their emergence. When he is not conducting cool experiments in the lab, his interests extend to reading strange books (in some circles), playing the sports, and experimenting with culinary arts, turning those who frequent his household into (un)willing culinary guinea pigs.

				This book aims to answer two simple questions: How and why did life become so diverse? It is an accessible, upper level textbook aimed principally at graduate students and practising researchers interested in the evolution of biodiversity, particularly through the lens of experimental evolution. The second edition (2024) presents updated analyses and new chapters on novelty and innovation, repeated evolution, and coevolution.
